<section xml:id="Equations-with-Fractions" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Equations with Fractions</title>

<subsection><title>"Clearing" Fractions</title>

<p>How can we solve an equation that involves algebraic fractions?  Recall that to solve the equation
	<me>\dfrac{3x}{4} = 9</me>
 we multiply both sides by 4 (the denominator of the fraction) to "clear" the fraction.
 	<md><mrow>\cancel{\blert{4}}(\dfrac{3x}{\cancel{4}}) \amp = (9)\blert{4}</mrow>
 		<mrow>3x \amp = 36</mrow></md>
 We can now finish the solution to get <m>x=12</m>.</p>
	
<p>We use the same idea to solve an equation with algebraic fractions.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve  <m>~~\dfrac{5000+50x}{x} = 75</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We multiply both sides of the equation by <m>x</m>, the denominator of the fraction, to get
	<md><mrow>\cancel{\blert{x}}(\dfrac{5000+50x}{\cancel{x}}) \amp = (75)\blert{x}</mrow>
 		<mrow>5000+50x \amp = 75x</mrow></md>
Then we proceed as usual to finish the solution. We subtract <m>50x</m> from both sides to find
  	<md><mrow>5000 \amp = 25x</mrow>
  		<mrow>200 \amp = x</mrow></md>
You can check that <m>x=200</m> does satisfy the equation.</p></solution></example>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Using an LCD to Clear Fractions</title>

<p>If an equation contains more than one fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all the fractions. This will clear all the denominators at once.</p>
   
<example xml:id="Example-8-4-2"><statement><p>Solve <m>~~\dfrac{x}{3} -2 = \dfrac{4}{5} + \dfrac{x}{5}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The LCD of <m>~\dfrac{x}{3},~ \dfrac{4}{5}</m> and <m>~\dfrac{x}{5}</m> is 15. We multiply both sides of the equation by 15.
	<md><mrow>\blert{15}\left(\dfrac{x}{3} -2\right)  \amp = \left(\dfrac{4}{5} + \dfrac{x}{5}\right)\blert{15} \amp \amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>\blert{15}\left(\dfrac{x}{3}\right)- \blert{15}(2)  \amp = \blert{15}\left(\dfrac{4}{5}\right) + \blert{15}\left(\dfrac{x}{5}\right) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Simplify each product.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>5x-30 \amp = 12+3x</mrow></md>
Now we can proceed as usual to complete the solution.
	<md><mrow>5x-30 \amp = 12+3x \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Subtract}~3x~\text{from both sides;}}</mrow>
		<mrow>\amp \amp\amp  \blert{\text{add 30 to both sides.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>2x \amp = 42 \amp\amp   \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>x \amp = 21</mrow></md></p></solution></example>

<warning><p>In <xref ref="Example-8-4-2" text="type-global"/>, note that we multiplied each term by the LCD, 15, including terms that are not fractions, namely 2 in this example. Be sure to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD.</p></warning>

	by the LCD?</p></statement>

<subsection><title>Variables in the Denominator</title>

<p>Equations that involve algebraic fractions can also be solved using an LCD.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-8-4-3"><statement><p>Solve  <m>~~\dfrac{3}{4} = 8- \dfrac{2x+11}{x-5}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is <m>\blert{4(x-5)}</m>. We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD.
	<md><mrow>\blert{4(x-5)}\left(\dfrac{3}{4}\right)  \amp = \left(8- \dfrac{2x+11}{x-5}\right) \cdot \blert{4(x-5)} ~~~~~~~~  \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>\blert{\cancel{4}(x-5)}\left(\dfrac{3}{\cancel{4}}\right)  \amp = \blert{4(x-5)}(8)- \blert{4\cancel{(x-5)}}\left(\dfrac{2x+11}{x-5}\right)</mrow>
		<mrow>3(x-5) \amp = 32(x-5)-4(2x+11)</mrow></md>
We proceed as usual to complete the solution. First we use the distributive law to remove parentheses.
	<md><mrow>3x-15 \amp = 32x-160-8x-44 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Combine like terms.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>3x-15 \amp = 24x-204</mrow>
		<mrow>-21x \amp = -189</mrow>
		<mrow>x \amp = 9</mrow></md>
The solution is <m>x=9</m>. You can check that <m>x=9</m> satisfies the original equation.</p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="2"><statement><p>How do we "clear" the fractions from an equation?</p></statement>
    <answer><p>Multiply both sides by the LCD.</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<assemblage><title>Look Ahead</title>
<p>	Remember that we do not obtain an equivalent equation if we multiply both sides of an equation by zero. In <xref ref="Example-8-4-3" text="type-global"/> we multiplied by <m>4(x-5)</m>. Is it possible that <m>4(x-5)</m> equals zero? After solving, we found that <m>x=9</m>, so <m>4(x-5) = 16</m>, which is not zero, and the multiplication step was valid. The next example illustrates what can go wrong if we multiply by zero.</p></assemblage>

<subsection><title>Extraneous Solutions</title>

<example xml:id="Example-8-4-4"><statement><p>Solve  <m>~~6 +\dfrac{4}{x-3} = \dfrac{x+1}{x-3}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD, <m>x-3</m>, to clear the fractions.
	<md><mrow>\blert{(x-3)}\left(6+\dfrac{4}{x-3}\right) \amp = \left(\dfrac{x+1}{x-3}\right) \cdot \blert{(x-3)} ~~~~~  \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>\blert{(x-3)}(6)+\blert{\cancel{(x-3)}}\left(\dfrac{4}{\cancel{x-3}}\right) \amp = \left(\dfrac{x+1}{x-3}\right)\blert{\cancel{(x-3)}}</mrow>
		<mrow>6(x-3) + 4 \amp = x+1</mrow></md>
We complete the solution as usual.
	<md><mrow>6x-18 +4 \amp = x+1</mrow>
		<mrow>6x-14 \amp = x+1</mrow>
		<mrow>5x \amp = 15</mrow>
		<mrow>x \amp = 3</mrow></md>
The solution appears to be <m>x=3</m>. But we have a problem, because the LCD, <m>x-3</m>, equals zero when <m>x=3</m>. We have multiplied both sides of the equation by zero. When we try to check the solution we find
	<md><mrow> 6 + \dfrac{4}{3-3} \amp = \dfrac{3+1}{3-3} ~~~~~~\blert{\text{Simplify each term.}}</mrow>
		<mrow> 6 + \dfrac{4}{0} \amp = \dfrac{3+1}{0}</mrow></md>
Because division by zero is undefined, 3 is not a solution after all. The original equation does not have a solution.</p></solution></example>

<p>In <xref ref="Example-8-4-4" text="type-global"/>, when we multiplied both sides of the equation by zero we found a false solution for the equation.  Such solutions are called <term>extraneous solutions</term>. There is always a danger that an extraneous solution may be introduced when we multiply by an expression that contains the variable.</p>  

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="3"><statement><p>When might an extraneous solution be introduced?</p></statement>
    <answer><p>When we multiply by an expression that contains the variable.</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<assemblage><p>We should always check for extraneous solutions when solving equations that involve algebraic fractions.</p></assemblage>

<p>To check a solution, we substitute it into the original equation. If a possible solution causes any of the denominators in the equation to equal zero, then that solution is extraneous.</p>

<reading-questions>

    <answer><p>See if it causes any of the denominators in the equation to equal zero.</p></answer></exercise>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Formulas</title>

<p>	We can also solve formulas that involve algebraic fractions.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve for <m>P</m>: <m>~~\dfrac{1}{T} = \dfrac{PR}{A-P}</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>The LCD for the two fractions in the equation is <m>\blert{T(A-P)}</m>. We multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to obtain
	<md><mrow>\blert{\cancel{T}(A-P)} \dfrac{1}{\cancel{T}} \amp = \dfrac{PR}{\cancel{A-P}}\blert{T\cancel{(A-P)}}</mrow>
		<mrow>A-P \amp = PRT</mrow></md>
Next, we get all the terms containing the desired variable, <m>P</m>, on one side of the equation. We add <m>P</m> to both sides to get
	<me>A=P+PRT</me>
We now have two unlike terms that contain the desired variable. To proceed, we factor out this variable, and then divide both sides by the remaining factor.
<md><mrow>A \amp = P(1+RT)~~~~~~~~~\blert{\text{Divide both sides by}~1+RT.}</mrow>
		<mrow>\dfrac{A}{\blert{1+RT}} \amp = \dfrac{P\cancel{(1+RT)}}{\blert{\cancel{1+RT}}}</mrow></md>
Thus, the new version of the formula is
	<me>P=\dfrac{A}{1+RT}</me></p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="5"><statement><p>When solving a formula, what should we do if there are two terms that 
	contain the variable?</p></statement>
    <answer><p>Factor out the variable.</p></answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>Applications</title>

<p>	Recall the formula <m>d=rt</m>, which is useful in solving problems about motion. By solving for <m>r</m> or <m>t</m>, we can write the equation in the forms
	<me>r = \dfrac{d}{t}~~~~~~\text{or}~~~~~~t = \dfrac{d}{r}</me>
if either of these is more useful for the problem.</p>

<example><statement><p>A cruise boat travels 18 miles downstream and back in <m>4\dfrac{1}{2}</m> hours. If the speed of the current is 3 miles per hour, what is the speed of the boat in still water?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We let <m>x</m> stand for unknown quantity, the speed of the boat in still water. Then we make a table showing the distance, rate, and time for each part of the trip. We begin by filling in the information given in the problem.</p>

<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                    <row bottom="minor">
                        <cell><m>\hphantom{0000}</m></cell>
                        <cell>Distance</cell>
                        <cell>Rate</cell>
                        <cell>Time</cell></row>
                    <row> 
             			<cell>Downstream trip</cell>
                        <cell><m>18</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>x+3</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>\hphantom{0000}</m></cell></row>
                    <row> 
                        <cell>Upstream trip</cell>
                        <cell><m>18</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>x-3</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>\hphantom{0000}</m></cell></row>
                    </tabular></sidebyside>
<p>We use the formula <m>t = \dfrac{d}{r}</m> to fill in the last column of the table.</p>

<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">              
                    <row bottom="minor">
                        <cell><m>\hphantom{0000}</m></cell>
                        <cell>Distance</cell>
                        <cell>Rate</cell>
                        <cell>Time</cell></row>
                    <row> 
             			<cell>Downstream trip</cell>
                        <cell><m>18</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>x+3</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>\blert{\dfrac{18}{x+3}}</m></cell></row>
                    <row> 
                        <cell>Upstream trip</cell>
                        <cell><m>18</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>x-3</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>\blert{\dfrac{18}{x-3}}</m></cell></row>
                    </tabular></sidebyside>

<p>Notice that we did not use the <m>4\dfrac{1}{2}</m> hours in the table, because it was not the trip upstream or the trip downstream that took <m>4\dfrac{1}{2}</m> hours, but the total trip. We use the <m>4\dfrac{1}{2}</m> to write an equation. The sum of the times for the upstream and downstream trips was <m>4\dfrac{1}{2}</m> or <m>\dfrac{9}{2}</m> hours.
	<me> \dfrac{18}{x+3}+\dfrac{18}{x-3} = \dfrac{9}{2}</me>
To solve the equation, we multiply both sides by the LCD, <m>2(x-3)(x+3)</m>. 
	<me> \blert{2(x-3)(x+3)}(\dfrac{18}{x+3}+\dfrac{18}{x-3}) = (\dfrac{9}{2})\blert{2(x-3)(x+3)}</me>
Next, we apply the distributive law to multiply each term of the equation by the LCD.
	<md><mrow> \blert{2(x-3)\cancel{(x+3)}}(\dfrac{18}{\cancel{x+3}})+\blert{2\cancel{(x-3)}(x+3)}(\dfrac{18}{\cancel{x-3}}) \amp = (\dfrac{9}{\cancel{2}})\blert{\cancel{2}(x-3)(x+3)}</mrow>
	<mrow>36(x-3)+36(x+3) \amp = 9(x-3)(x+3)</mrow></md>
We simplify each side of the equation and write it in standard form.
	<md><mrow>36x-108+36x+108 \amp = 9x^2-81~~~~~~~~\blert{\text{Combine like terms.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>9x^2-72x-81 \amp =0</mrow></md>
The equation is quadratic, and we can solve it by factoring.
	<md><mrow>9(x^2-8x-9) \amp = 0</mrow>
		<mrow>9(x-9)(x+1) \amp = 0~~~~~~~~\blert{\text{Set each factor equal to zero.}}</mrow>
		<mrow>x-9=0~~~~x+1 \amp = 0</mrow>
		<mrow>x=9~~~~~~~~~~x \amp =-1</mrow></md>
Finally, we check each solution by substituting into the original equation. Neither solution is extraneous. However, the speed of the boat is not a negative number, so we discard the solution <m>x=-1</m>. The boat travels at 9 miles per hour in still water.</p></solution></example>

<p>Problems involving other types of rates can be solved with similar techniques. Suppose it takes you 8 hours to type a term paper for your history class. If you work at a constant rate, in 1 hour you would complete <m>\dfrac{1}{8}</m> of your task. The rate at which you work, or your work rate, is one-eighth job per hour. In 3 hours you would complete  
	<me>3 \cdot \dfrac{1}{8} = \dfrac{3}{8}</me>
of the job. In <m>t</m> hours you would complete    
	<me>t \cdot \dfrac{1}{8} = \dfrac{t}{8}</me>
of the job. In general, the amount of work done, expressed as a fraction of 1 whole job, is given by the following  formula.</p>

<subsubsection><title>Activity 3: Work Problem</title>

<p>	In this application, the work being done is the water flowing into (or out of) the reservoir, so the work rate is the flow rate of water through the pipes.</p>

<p>The city reservoir was completely emptied for repairs, and is now being refilled. Water flows in through the intake pipe at a steady rate that can fill the reservoir in 120 days. However, water is also being drained from the reservoir as it is used by the city, so that it actually takes 150 days to fill. After the reservoir is filled, the water supply is turned off, but the city continues to use water at the same rate. How long will it take to drain the reservoir dry?
<ol label="a">
<li><p>Let <m>d</m> stand for the number of days for the outflow pipe to drain the full reservoir.</p>
