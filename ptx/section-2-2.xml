<subsection><title>Writing Algebraic Expressions</title>

<p>When we write an algebraic expression, we use the same operations on a variable that we would use to calculate with a specific number. Writing down the expression for a specific numerical value can help us write an algebraic expression.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-2-2-1"><statement><p>Alida keeps $100 in cash from her weekly paycheck, and deposits 40% of the remainder in her savings account. If Alida's paycheck is <m>p</m>, write an expression for the amount she deposits in savings.</p></statement>

<solution><p>How would we calculate Alida's deposit if we knew her paycheck? Suppose Alida's paycheck is $500. First she subtracts $100 from that amount to get <m>500-100</m>, and then she takes 40% of the remainder for savings:
	<me>0.40(\alert{500}-100)~~~~~\blert{\text{Perform operations inside parentheses first.}}</me>
If her paycheck is <m>p</m> dollars, we perform the same operations on <m>p</m> instead of on 500. The expression is thus
	<me>0.40(\alert{p}-100)</me></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Evaluating Algebraic Expressions</title>

<p>When we evaluate an algebraic expression, we must follow the order of operations.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-2-2-2"><statement><p>Four students bought concert tickets with their $20 student-discount coupons.<ol label="a">
	<li>If the regular price of a ticket is <m>t</m> dollars, write an expression for the total amount the four students paid.</li>
	<li>How much did the students pay if the regular price of a ticket is $38?</li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>The discount price of one ticket is <m>t-20</m> dollars. So four tickets cost 
		<me>4(t-20)~~\text{dollars}</me></p></li>
	<li><p>We evaluate the expression in part (a) for <m>t=\alert{38}</m>.        
		<md><mrow>4(t-20) \amp = 4(\alert{38}-20) \amp  \blert{\text{Simplify inside parentheses first.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 4(18)=72</mrow></md>                
		The students paid $72 for the tickets.</p></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="3"><statement><p>Explain why we need parentheses in <xref ref="Example-2-2-2" text="type-global"/>.</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>We need to subtract before we multiply.</p></answer></exercise>
    <exercise number="4"><statement><p>How should we write "3 times the sum of <m>x</m> and 12"?</p></statement>
    	<answer><p><m>3(x+12)</m></p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Negative Numbers</title>

<p>The order of operations applies to signed numbers. Operations inside parentheses or other grouping devices should be performed first.</p>

<example><statement><p>Simplify  <m>~~4-3-[-6+(-5)-(-2)]</m></p></statement>

<solution><p>Perform the operations inside brackets first. Simplify each step by rewriting subtractions as equivalent additions. 
    <md><mrow>\amp 4-3- [-6+\blert{(-5)-(-2)}] \amp\amp  \blert{-5-(-2)=-5+2}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\,\amp  4-3-[\blert{-6-5+2}] \amp\amp \blert{-6-5=-11;~-11+2=-9}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\,\amp  4 \blert{-3-[-9]} \amp\amp \blert{\text{Rewrite as an addition.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\,\amp  4-3+9 = 10 \amp\amp  \blert{\text{Add from left to right.}}</mrow>        
    </md></p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="5"><statement><p>Which operation is performed first in the expression <m>6-4x</m>?</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>multiplication</p></answer></exercise>
    <exercise number="6"><statement><p>What is the first step in evaluating the expression <m>2(18-x)</m>?</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>Subtract <m>x</m> from 18</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<warning><p>When using negative numbers, we must be careful to distinguish between products and sums.  In <xref ref="Example-2-2-4" text="type-global"/>, note how the parentheses and minus signs are used in each expression.</p></warning>

<example xml:id="Example-2-2-4"><statement><p>Simplify each expression.<ol label="a" cols="4">
	<li><m>3(-8)</m></li>
	<li><m>3-(-8)</m></li>
	<li><m>3-8</m></li>
	<li><m>-3-8</m></li></ol></p></statement>
<solution><p><ol label="a">
	<li><p>This expression is a product: <m>~3(-8)=-24</m></p></li> 
	<li><p>This is a subtraction. We follow the rule for subtraction by changing the sign of the second number and then adding: <m>~3-(-8)=3+8=11</m></p></li> 
	<li><p>This is an addition; the negative sign in front of  tells us that we are adding <m>-8</m> to <m>3</m>. Thus, <m>~3-8=3+(-8)=-5</m></p></li> 
	<li><p>This is also an addition: <m>~-3-8=-3+(-8)=-11</m></p></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<reading-questions>
    <exercise number="7"><statement><p>What is wrong with this calculation: <m>4-3+9=4-12=-8</m>?</p></statement>
    	<answer><p>We should subtract <m>4-3</m> first.</p></answer></exercise>
</reading-questions>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>When we evaluate an algebraic expression at a negative number, we enclose the negative numbers in parentheses. This will help prevent us from confusing multiplication with subtraction.</p></assemblage>

<example><statement><p>Evaluate <m>2x-3xy</m> for <m>x=-5</m> and <m>y=-2</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We substitute <m>\alert{-5}</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>\blert{-2}</m> for <m>y</m>, then follow the order of operations.
    <md><mrow>2x-3xy \amp = 2(\alert{-5})-3(\alert{-5})(\blert{-2})  \amp \blert{\text{ Do multiplications first.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = -10-(-15)(-2)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = -10-30=-40</mrow>         
    </md></p></solution></example>

    <exercise number="8"><statement><p>When we evaluate an expression at a negative number, we should <fillin characters="6"/> the negative number in <fillin characters="6"/>.</p></statement>
