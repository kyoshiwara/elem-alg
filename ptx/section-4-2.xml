<section xml:id="Systems-of-Linear-Equations"   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Systems of Linear Equations</title>

<subsection><title>What is a System of Equations?</title>

<p>In many applications it is useful to write two or more linear equations.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-4-2-1"><statement><p>Delbert and Francine are buying appliances for their new home. They have a choice of two different refrigerators:  a standard model that sells for $1000, or an energy-efficient model at a price of $1200. The standard model costs $6 per month to run, and the energy-efficient model costs $2 per month. Write linear equations for the total cost of each refrigerator after <m>t</m> months.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Let <m>S</m> stand for the total cost of running the standard refrigerator for <m>t</m> months, so <m>S=mt+b</m>.  The initial cost of the standard model is $1000, so <m>b=1000</m>. The cost increases at a rate of $6 per month, so <m>m=6</m>. Thus,
	<me>S=6t+1000</me>   
Let <m>E</m> stand for the total cost of running the energy-efficient refrigerator. For this model, the initial cost is <m>b=1200</m>, and the total cost increases at a rate of <m>2</m> dollars per month. Thus,
	<me>E=2t+1200</me></p></solution></example>

<assemblage><title>Look Closer</title>
<p>When we consider two equations together, as in the example above, we often use the same variables for both equations, like this:
	<md><mrow>y=6x+1000</mrow>
		<mrow>y=2x+1200</mrow></md>
</p></assemblage>

<assemblage><title>System</title>
    <p>A pair of linear equations with the same variables is called a <term>system of linear equations</term>.</p>
</assemblage> 

<p>In <xref ref="Example-4-2-1" text="type-global"/>, the standard refrigerator costs less initially, but costs more to run each month. Delbert and Francine want to know when the energy-efficient model will begin to pay for itself, or in other words, when the total cost of running the standard model will exceed the total cost of the energy-efficient model.</p>  

<example xml:id="Example-4-2-2"><statement><p>When is the total cost of running the two refrigerators in <xref ref="Example-4-2-1" text="type-global"/> equal?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We would like to know the value of <m>t</m> when <m>S=E</m>. We could use trial-and-error by evaluating both <m>S</m> and <m>E</m> for various values of <m>t</m>. The results of such a search are given in the table below.</p>

<p>We see that when <m>t=50</m>, the total cost of both models is $1300. Thus, at the end of 50 months, or 4 years 2 months, the cost of the standard model equals the cost of the energy-efficient model.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Solving a System of Equations by Graphing</title>

<p>The solution of a system satisfies both equations in the system, so the point that represents the solution must lie on both graphs. It is the intersection point of the two lines described by the system. Thus, we can solve a system of equations by graphing the equations and looking for the point (or points) where the graphs intersect.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-4-2-3"><statement><p>Solve the system in <xref ref="Example-4-2-1" text="type-global"/> by graphing.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The graph of the two equations is shown below. The graph of <m>S</m> has a smaller initial value than <m>E</m>, but it increases more rapidly because its slope is greater. The two graphs intersect at the point labeled <m>P</m>.</p>

<p>At this point the values of <m>S</m> and <m>E</m> are the same, approximately 1300. The <m>t</m>-coordinate of point  is 50, so the solution of the system is <m>(50,1300)</m>. The total cost of each model is about $1300 over the first 50 months of operation.</p></solution></example>

<p>After 50 months, the total cost of the energy-efficient model will be less than the cost of the standard model.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-4-2-4"><statement><p>Delbert and Francine are also shopping for homeowners insurance. HomeLife offers a policy for semiannual premiums of $408, or they can join a co-op for $50 and pay just $68 per month for comparable coverage. Which option is less expensive in the long run?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We'll write a system of equations and graph them, as we did in <xref ref="Example-4-2-3" text="type-global"/>. If <m>t</m> stands for the number of months, then the total cost of the co-op insurance is
        <me>C=50+68t</me>
and the HomeLife policy costs
        <me>H=\dfrac{408}{6}t=68t</me>
because a semiannual premium covers 6 months. The solution of the system represents the time when the costs of the two policies are equal. The graphs of the two equations are shown below.</p>

<p>As you can see, the two lines are parallel, so the graphs do not intersect. This system has no solution. There is no point where the two policies cost the same amount; the HomeLife policy is always less expensive.</p></solution></example>

<p>In <xref ref="Example-4-2-4" text="type-global"/>, the two graphs never intersect, so the system has no solution. Such a system is called <term>inconsistent</term>. There is a third possibility:  Both equations may have the same graph.</p>

<p>The second equation, which has the form <m>Ax+By=C</m>, is easier to graph by the intercept method. You can verify that its intercepts are <m>(0,2)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m>. The graph of the second line is identical to the first graph.</p>
<p> Every solution to the first equation is also a solution to the second equation, so every point on the line is a solution of the system as well. The system has infinitely many solutions.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Problem Solving with Systems</title>

<p>Many practical problems involve two or more unknown quantities. Often it is easier to solve these problems by using two variables and writing a system of equations.</p>

<example><statement><p>Allen has been asked to design a rectangular Plexiglas plate whose perimeter is 28 inches and whose length is three times its width. What should the dimensions of the plate be?</p></statement>

<solution><p>Step 1 The dimensions of a rectangle are its length and width, so we let <m>x</m> represent the width of the plate and <m>y</m> represent its length.</p>  
<p>Step 2 We must write two equations about the length and width of the plate. We know a formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, <m>P=2l+2w</m>, so the first equation is
    <me>2x+2y=28</me>
We also know that the length is three times the width, or <m>y=3x</m>. These two equations make a system.

<subsubsection><title>Activity 1: Solving Systems by Graphing</title>

<p>A biologist wants to know the average weights of two species of birds in a wildlife preserve. She sets up a feeder whose platform is actually a scale, and mounts a camera to monitor the feeder. She waits until the feeder is occupied only by members of the two species she is studying, robins and thrushes. Then she takes a picture, which records the number of each species on the scale, and the total weight registered.</p>  

<p>From her two best pictures, she obtains the following information. <ul>
    <li>The total weight of three thrushes and six robins is 48 ounces, and</li>
    <li>The total weight of five thrushes and two robins is 32 ounces.</li></ul></p> 
<p><ol label="a">

    <p>Write two equations about the weights of the birds:

<p>The manager for Books for Cooks plans to spend $300 stocking a new diet cookbook. The paperback version costs her $5, and the hardback costs $10. She finds that she will sell three times as many paperbacks as hardbacks. How many of each should she buy?</p>

<p>Robert and Ruth are moving from Los Angeles to Baltimore. Robert is driving a rental truck at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Ruth leaves one day later in their car, and averages 65 miles per hour. When Ruth set out, Robert had already traveled 300 miles. When will Ruth catch up with Robert?</p>

<exercises>
<exercise><statement><p>Let <m>t</m> stand for the number of hours that Ruth has traveled. When she catches up with Robert, they will both have traveled the same distance, so we begin by writing equations for the distance, <m>d</m>, each has traveled after <m>t</m> hours.<ol label="a">  
    <li>Ruth travels at 65 miles per hour, so an equation for the distance she has traveled is
        <me>\blert{\text{Ruth's distance:}}~~~d = </me></li>                              
    <li>Robert's speed is 50 miles per hour, but he has already traveled 300 miles when Ruth starts, so his distance is given by
        <me>\blert{\text{Robert's distance:}}~~~d = </me></li>                          
    <li>Together, the two equations form a system:</li></ol></p></statement></exercise>
