<subsection><title>Lesson 3.1 Intercepts</title><p><ul>
<li>The <term>intercepts</term> of a line are the points where the graph crosses the axes.</li>
<li>The intercepts of a graph often represent the starting or ending values for a particular variable.</li>

<li><assemblage><p><ul>
	<li><p>To find the <m>x</m>-intercept of a graph:</p>
	<p>Substitute <m>0</m> for <m>y</m> in the equation and solve for <m>x</m>.</p></li>

	<li><p>To find the <m>y</m>-intercept of a graph:</p>
	<p>Substitute <m>0</m> for <m>x</m> in the equation and solve for <m>y</m>.</p></li></ul></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>To Graph a Linear Equation Using the Intercept Method</title><p><ol label="1">
	<li><p>Find the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercepts of the graph.</p></li>   
	<li>Draw the line through the two intercepts.</li>
	<li>Find a third point on the graph as a check. (Choose any convenient value for <m>x</m> and solve for <m>y</m>.)</li>
</ol></p></assemblage></li>
</ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 3.2 Ratio and Proportion</title><p><ul>
<li>A <term>ratio</term> is a type of quotient that allows us to compare two numerical quantities.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>Ratio</title>
<p>The ratio of <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> is written <m>\dfrac{a}{b}</m>.</p></assemblage></li>

<li>A <term>rate</term> is a ratio that compares two quantities with different units.</li>
<li>A <term>proportion</term> is a statement that two ratios are equal. In other words, a proportion is a type of equation in which both sides are ratios.</li>
<li>We use cross-multiplying to solve proportions.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>Property of Proportions</title>
<p><me>\text{If}~~\dfrac{a}{b}=\dfrac{c}{d},~~~\text{then}~~~ad=bc.</me></p></assemblage></li>

<li>Two variables are said to be <term>proportional</term> if their ratios are always the same.</li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 3.3 Slope</title><p><ul>
<li>The slope of a line measures the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>Slope</title>
<p>The <term>slope</term> of a line is defined by the ratio
	<me>\blert{\dfrac{\text{change in } y\text{-coordinate}}{\text{change in } x\text{-coordinate}}}</me>
as we move from one point to another on the line. In symbols,
	<me>\blert{m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}</me></p></assemblage></li>

<li>Lines have constant slope. No matter what two points on a line we use to calculate its slope, we always get the same result.</li> 
<li>The slope of a horizontal line is zero, and the slope of a vertical line is undefined.</li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 3.4 Slope-Intercept Form</title><p><ul>

<li><assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
<p>A linear equation written in the form
		<me>y=mx+b</me>
is said to be in <term>slope-intercept form</term>. The coefficient <m>m</m> is the slope of the graph, and<m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept.</p></assemblage></li>

<li>The constant term in the slope-intercept form tells us the initial value of <m>y</m>, and the coefficient of <m>x</m> tells us the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</li>

<li><assemblage><title>To Graph a Line Using the Slope-Intercept Method</title>
<p><ol label="1">
	<li>Write the equation in the form <m>y=mx+b</m>.</li> 
	<li>Plot the  <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0,b)</m>.</li> 
	<li>Write the slope as a fraction, <m>m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>.</li> 
	<li>Use the slope to find a second point on the graph:
	Starting at the <m>y</m>-intercept, move <m>{\Delta y}</m> units in the <m>y</m>-direction, then <m>{\Delta x}</m> units in the <m>x</m>-direction.</li>
	<li>Find a third point by moving <m>{-\Delta y}</m> units in the <m>y</m>-direction, then <m>{-\Delta x}</m> units in the <m>x</m>-direction, starting from the <m>y</m>-intercept.</li>
	<li>Draw a line through the three plotted points.</li></ol></p></assemblage></li></ul></p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Lesson 3.5 Properties of Lines</title><p><ul>

<li><assemblage><title>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</title>
<p><ol label="1">
	<li><p>Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, that is, if
		<me>m_1 = m_2</me>		
	or if both lines are vertical.</p></li>
	<li><p>Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is <m>-1</m>, that is, if 
		<me>m_1 m_2 = -1</me>
	or if one of the lines is horizontal and one is vertical.</p></li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Horizontal and Vertical Lines</title>
<p><ol label="1">
	<li><p>The equation of the horizontal line passing through <m>(0,b)</m> is
			<me>\blert{y=b}</me></p></li>
	<li><p>The equation of the vertical line passing through <m>(a,0)</m> is
			<me>\blert{x=a}</me></p></li></ol></p></assemblage></li>

<li><assemblage><title>Two-Point Formula for Slope</title>
<p>The slope of the line joining points <m>P_1(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>P_2(x_2,y_2)</m> is
	<me>\blert{m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}~~~~~~\text{if}~~~~x_2 \not= x_1</me></p></assemblage></li></ul></p></subsection>
