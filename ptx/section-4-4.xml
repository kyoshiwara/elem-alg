<section xml:id="Problem-Solving-with-Systems"   xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Problem Solving with Systems</title>

<subsection><p>In this section we explore some applications of systems of equations.  We begin by reviewing some familiar formulas. </p></subsection>

<subsection><title>Interest</title>

<p>Recall the formula for calculating interest,
<me>\blert{I=Prt}</me>
 where <m>I</m> is the interest you will earn after <m>t</m> years if you invest a principal of <m>P</m> dollars in an account that earns simple interest at an annual rate <m>r</m>. </p>

 <warning><p>Notice the difference between interest, <m>I</m>, and interest rate, <m>r</m>. The interest rate is a percentage, such as 5%. The interest is the amount of money you earn, usually in dollars.</p></warning>

 <p>If we make two or more investments at the same time, then the total interest we earn is the sum of the interests earned on each investment separately.</p>

<activity>
<statement><p>Harvey deposited $1200 in two accounts. He put $700 in a savings account that pays 6% annual interest rate, and the rest in his credit union, which pays 7% annual interest rate. How much will Harvey's investments earn in two years?</p>

<p>Step 1 Calculate the interest earned by each account.
        <md><mrow>\amp\blert{\text{Savings}}\amp\amp \blert{I=Prt=}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp\blert{\text{Credit Union}}\amp\amp \blert{I=Prt=}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Step 2 Add the earnings from the two investments.
    <me>\blert{\binom{\text{Total}}{\text{<E></E>arnings}} = \binom{\text{Earnings from}}{\text{Savings}}+\binom{\text{Earnings from}}{\text{Credit Union}}} </me>
    </p></statement>
<answer><p>$154</p></answer></activity>

<p>Here is a similar example with variables.</p>

<activity>
<statement><p>You have $5000 to invest for one year. You want to put part of the money into bonds that pay 7% interest rate and the rest of the money into stocks, which involve some risk but will pay 12% if the investment is successful.</p>

</reading-questions>

<example xml:id="Example-4-4-1"><statement><p>Mort invested money in two accounts, a savings plan that pays 8% interest and a mutual fund that pays 7% interest. He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund. At the end of the year Mort's total interest income was $345. How much did he invest in each account?</p></statement>

<solution><p>The unknown quantities are the amounts Mort invested in his two accounts.

            <mrow>\amp\text{Amount invested in mutual fund:}\amp\amp y</mrow></md></p>
<p>Do not confuse the amount Mort invested in each account (the principal) with the amount he earned in interest! A table is a good way to keep these amounts straight.

<p>We must write two equations for the problem, one about the principal and one about the interest. <ul>
    <li><p>Equation about Principal: From the statement "He put twice as much money in the savings plan as in the mutual fund," we write the equation
    <md alignment="alignat">
        <mrow>\amp\amp\blert{\binom{\small\text{Amount invested}}{\small\text{in savings plan}}} \amp\blert{{}= 2\cdot\binom{\small\text{Amount invested}} {\small\text{in mutual fund}}} </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\blert{\text{Equation about principal:}}\amp x\qquad\quad~\amp = 2y</mrow></md>
</p></li>
    <li><p>Equation about Interest: From the statement "Mort's total interest income was $345," we write the equation
    <md alignment="alignat">
        <mrow>\amp\amp\blert{\binom{\small\text{Interest from}}{\small\text{savings plan}}+\binom{\small\text{Interest from}}{\small\text{mutual fund}}} \amp\blert{{}= \binom{\small\text{Total}}{\small\text{interest}}}  </mrow>
        <mrow>\amp\blert{\text{Equation about interest:}}\amp 0.08x~~\quad +\qquad 0.07y\quad~~\amp = 345</mrow></md>
    </p></li></ul></p>

<p>This gives us a system of equations.
    <md><mrow>x=2y</mrow>     
        <mrow>0.08x+0.07y=345</mrow></md>
Because the first equation is already solved for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>, we'll use the substitution method to solve the system. We substitute <m>2y</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation and solve for <m>y</m>.  
    <md><mrow>0.08(\alert{2y})+0.07y \amp = 345</mrow>
        <mrow>0.16y+0.07y \amp = 345 \amp\amp \blert{\text{Combine like terms.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>0.23y \amp = 345   \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 0.23.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>y \amp = 1500</mrow></md>         
Finally, we substitute <m>y=\alert{1500}</m> into the first equation to find 
    <me>x=2y=2(\alert{1500})=3000</me>
Thus, Mort invested $3000 in the savings plan and $1500 in the mutual fund.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Mixtures</title>

<p>A pharmacist has on hand 20 ounces of a certain drug at 40% strength, but she needs a small quantity of the drug at 75% strength for a prescription. She decides to add a pure form of the drug to the 40% solution. How much should she add to make a mixture of 75% strength?</p>

<p>To solve such problems, we review some properties of percent. We will need the percent formula,
	<me>\blert{P=rW}</me>
<m>P</m> stands for the part obtained when we take <m>r</m> percent of a whole amount, <m>W</m>.</p>

<p>Now we can write two equations about the mixture problem. The first equation is about the total number of milliliters mixed together. The chemist must mix <m>x</m> milliliters of one solution with <m>y</m> milliliters of the other solution and end up with 45 milliliters of the mixture, so
	<me>\blert{\text{Total amount of mixture:}}~~~~~~x+y=45</me>
The second equation uses the fact that the acid in the mixture can only come from the acid in each of the two original solutions. We used the last column of the table to calculate how much acid was in each component, and we add these quantities to get the amount of acid in the mixture.
	<me>\blert{\text{Amount of acid:}}~~~~~~0.20x+0.50y=0.40(45)</me>
These two equation make up a system:
	<md><mrow>x+y=45</mrow>
		<mrow>0.20x+0.50y=18</mrow></md>
To simplify the system we first multiply the second equation by 100 to clear the decimals. 
	<md><mrow>x+y=45</mrow>
		<mrow>20x+50y=1800</mrow></md>
We solve the system by elimination. Multiply the first equation by <m>-20</m>, and add the equations together.
	<md><mrow>-20x-20y \amp = -900</mrow>
        <mrow>\underline{20x+50y} \amp \underline{ {}= 1800\vphantom{y}}</mrow>
        <mrow>30y \amp = 900</mrow></md> 
Solving for <m>y</m>, we find <m>y=30</m>. We substitute <m>y=\alert{30}</m> into the first equation to find
	<me>x+\alert{30}=45</me>
or <m>x=15</m>. The chemist needs 15 milliliters of the 20% solution and 30 milliliters of the 50% solution for the mixture.</p></solution></example>

<p>Mixture problems are easy to solve if you complete a table first. The rows of the table represent the two components and the final mixture, and the columns are used to calculate the amount of the important ingredient in each. Here is a sample table that you can customize for the specifics of a particular problem.

<subsection><title>Motion</title>

<p>We can also use systems of equations to solve problems involving motion at a constant speed.  We'll need the formula <m>\blert{D=RT}</m>.</p>

<example xml:id="Example-4-4-3"><statement><p>Geologists can calculate the distance from their seismograph to the epicenter of an earthquake by timing the arrival of the P and S waves. They know that P waves travel at about 5.4 miles per second and S waves travel at 3.0 miles per second. If the P waves arrived 3 minutes before the S waves, how far away is the epicenter of the quake?</p></statement>

<solution><p>Let <m>x</m> represent the distance from the seismograph to the epicenter. The time it took for the waves to arrive is also unknown, so we'll let <m>y</m> be the travel time for the P waves, in seconds. The travel time for the S waves is then <m>y+180</m> seconds.</p>  
<p>We organize all this information in a table.
	<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">

                        <cell>Distance</cell></row>
                    <row><cell> P waves</cell>
                        <cell><m>5.4</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>y</m></cell>
                        <cell><m>x</m></cell></row>
                    <row><cell> S waves</cell>

                        <cell><m>y+180</m></cell>

                    </tabular></sidebyside></p>
<p>We can now write two equations about the problem, one for the P waves and one for the S waves, using the formula <m>RT=D</m>.	
		<md><mrow>5.4y=x</mrow>
		<mrow>3.0(y+180)=x</mrow></md>
We solve the system by substitution. We substitute <m>\alert{5.4y}</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation, and then solve for <m>y</m>.
	<md><mrow>3.0(y+180) \amp = \alert{5.4y} \amp\amp \blert{\text{Apply the distributive law.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>3y+540 \amp = 5.4y \amp\amp \blert{\text{Subtract}~3y~ \text{from both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>540\amp = 2.4y  \amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.4.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>225 \amp = y</mrow></md>    
Thus, it took the P waves 225 seconds to arrive at the seismograph. To solve for the distance <m>x</m>, we substitute <m>y=\alert{225}</m> into the first equation to find
	<me>x=5.4(\alert{225})=1215</me>
The epicenter is located 1215 miles from the seismograph.</p></solution></example>
